Summary: Core values of PyCon IL
Lang: en
page_number: 51

We have convened here to establish a cohort of individuals who share
similar values and are committed to advancing these principles through
collaborative efforts, in organizing an annual conference. This
distinguished event will focus on the Python programming language: its
core elements, related technologies, and the promotion of its learning
and application through channels of practice and knowledge
sharing. Our goal is to collectively create a dynamic, value-driven,
equitable, diverse, community-centric, and local annual event – "a
distinguished, high-quality, equitable, and community-oriented
conference with a far-reaching impact." In the course of our work, we
aim to cultivate a working environment for the organizing team, and
for everyone involved, that steadfastly upholds the values of
inclusion, mutual respect, and equality.
