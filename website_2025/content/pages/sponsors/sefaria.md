**Sefaria: Open Source Torah for the Digital Age**

Sefaria is an open-source platform dedicated to transforming Jewish
learning through technology. We've built a vast, free library of
interconnected Jewish texts, available in Hebrew and translation,
designed for web, tablet, and mobile. Our open-source code and live
API empower developers to create apps, visualizations, and research
tools that engage with this ancient corpus in new and innovative ways.

At PyCon, we're excited to share how we use modern software
development to make millennia of wisdom accessible to everyone. Visit
our booth to explore how you can leverage our API and contribute to
the future of Jewish learning.
