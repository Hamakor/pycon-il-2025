At Nym Health, we’re solving one of the most challenging problems in
healthcare: building an AI system that can truly understand clinical
language at scale.

We’ve developed a fully autonomous NLP engine that parses free-text
medical records and transforms them into structured, coded data, in
real time, with no human-in-the-loop.  Our system is already in
production, processing over 6 million patient charts annually across
leading U.S. healthcare systems.  It handles complex clinical
narratives, maps them to standardized code sets like ICD-10 and CPT,
and integrates seamlessly into existing workflows.

We’re headquartered in Tel Aviv and New York and expanding fast.
We’re scaling our platform to support new clinical domains and
increasingly complex data. We’re seeking strong engineers excited by
real-world, high-impact challenges in NLP, ML, and distributed
systems.
