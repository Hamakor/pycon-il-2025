All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are
kindly asked to adopt the following code of conduct, and are required
to agree to the Anti-Harassment Policy. We are expecting cooperation
from all participants to help ensure a safe and comfortable
environment for everybody.

The Quick Version
-----------------

Be friendly, patient, welcoming and considerate; be respectful, use
appropriate language, and avoid discriminatory behavior or
expressions. In particular, harassment is unacceptable; our conference
is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, and participants violating the Anti-Harassment Policy may be
sanctioned or even expelled from the conference without a refund, at
the discretion of the conference organizers.

The Full Version
----------------

- Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes
  and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
- Be patient and considerate. We all want to have fun teaching and
  learning, and a cooperative atmosphere will make us more productive.
- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
  disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor
  manners. Refrain from personal attacks, and be respectful when
  dealing with other members of the Python community as well as with
  people outside it.
- Use appropriate language, and avoid discriminatory
  behavior. Everybody is welcome to this conference, regardless of
  gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or
  religion (or lack thereof).
- We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
  form. Organizers will enforce the Anti-Harassment Policy throughout
  the event.
  
Anti-Harassment Policy
----------------------


- Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender
  identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or
  lack thereof); deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
  other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
  attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
  conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties and online
  media.
- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately.
- Sponsors are also subject to the Anti-Harassment Policy. In
  particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities,
  or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
  sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
  sexualized environment.
- If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
  warning the offender or even expulsion from the conference with no
  refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by the printing

If the matter is especially urgent, please call the conference staff

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact
hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and
workshop venues, conference-related social events and online spaces.
