We have gathered a collection of Call for Proposals
(CFP) resources, from workshops given over the years for
the conference. These resources are designed to provide you with the
necessary tools and knowledge to create successful submissions,
enhance your proposal writing skills, and connect with experienced
professionals in the field.

Here you can learn from experts and seasoned speakers:

- What CFPs are,
- How to craft compelling proposals,
- What is usually proposed for tech conferences,
- What are we looking for at PyCon Israel, and
- How to get to talk in conferences in general.
