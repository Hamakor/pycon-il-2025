Fun moments from Pycon 2024! Sharing one of the conference highlights:
StarkWare’s coding riddle. The prize? 1 ETH, worth approximately
$2,400 today.

In an impressive display of teamwork, five friends won the prize -
teaming up, cracking the riddle with the fastest solution, getting to
be the first team to withdraw the prize from the digital vault. What’s
even more heartwarming? These friends decided to award the prize to
their buddy – who was getting married the very next day.

Huge kudos to the
[StarkWare](https://www.linkedin.com/company/starkware/) team for
bringing both innovation and creativity to the conference—what an
amazing energy at the booth!
