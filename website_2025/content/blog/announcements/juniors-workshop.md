## üß† 4 Ideas for Junior Speakers‚Äô Talks @ Pycon Israel 2025
PyCon is coming ‚Äî and the Call for Proposals is open! You can submit your talk idea now through May 1st, so don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of the lineup. We love seeing fresh perspectives, and junior Python developers bring exactly that.

Whether you‚Äôve spent hours hunting down a tricky bug, significantly improved your code‚Äôs performance, or discovered surprising new uses for a familiar library ‚Äî your journey is packed with insights others can learn from. Maybe you have learned something interesting on modern unit and integration tools, or you‚Äôre deep into LLM-related tools like Cursor and how they tie into Python ‚Äî whatever your angle, we‚Äôd love to hear your story!

We welcome junior talks because your curiosity, creativity, and ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments are what keep the Python community growing and evolving ‚Äî plus, you ask the best questions!

Here are some suggestions for talk ideas:

1. **"Speed Boost: How I Made My Python Code Run (Way) Faster and What I Learned"** ‚Üí A journey into performance optimization and practical takeaways.
2. **"Beyond the Docs: Discovering Hidden Superpowers in a Python Library"** ‚Üí A talk about going deep into a well-known library and finding unexpected features.
3. **"My First Year of Bugs: What Debugging Taught Me About Writing Better Code"** ‚Üí A reflective and educational session on common pitfalls, debugging habits, and growth.
4. **"LLMs Meet Python: What I‚Äôve Learned Using Tools Like Cursor as a Junior Dev"** ‚Üí A junior‚Äôs perspective on integrating modern AI tools into their Python workflow.
