day of talks are finally available. It took a bit longer than we
expected (and we take the full responsibility for that), but they're
finally out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go catch up on whatever you missed -- there are
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PyConIsrael/playlists"&gt;playlists&lt;/a&gt; for the
whole day as well as per hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VenoW9pJSqWaXGvv9"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; from that
day, as well as &lt;a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xBMKNEnpUe4tfK7K8"&gt;those from the workshops
day&lt;/a&gt;, had already been
published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who made this happen!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="announcements"></category></entry></feed>
